<b><h1>Greetings!</h1></b>

## I'm **Nadeem**, a **senior software engineer** <br/> based in Bangalore, India.

###### I help build end-to-end solutions and solve complex problems.

<hr>
### As a passionate programmer since 8th grade driven by curiosity and exciting problems, I believe in creating engaging, meaningful products and experiences and using code to further scale the vision.

### Currently, you'll find me at **[Sprinto](https://www.sprinto.com)**, where I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer - centered around **[Node.js / JavaScript](garage.md)**.

### I like to build products and in the far future see my self as an indie hacker. I also like to teach programming, explain things and build silly software. Outside of programming I enjoy running, swimming and doing illustration on weekends.

###### _**Appreciate you swinging by. You're truly awesome**_.
