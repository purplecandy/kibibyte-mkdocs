<b><h1>Hey there,</h1></b>

I'm **[Nadeem](about.md)**, a passionate programmer. Sometimes an illustrator and a terrible writer.

Currently, you'll find me at **[Sprinto](https://www.sprinto.com)**, where I'm immersed in elevating our development landscape primarily centered around **[Node.js / JavaScript](garage.md)**.

When I'm not there, I'm clicking away to construct indie apps, fully embracing the path of an **[indie hacker](garage.md)**.

Feel free to delve into my array of **[projects]()** and **[GitHub repositories](https://github.com/purplecandy)**.

Speaking of which, I've a small collection writings you might enjoy.

For a more detailed look, here's my **[curriculum vitae](resume.md)**. Don't hesitate to drop a line â€“ I'm all ears!

Appreciate you swinging by. You're truly awesome.
