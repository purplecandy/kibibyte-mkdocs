          <p>
            I'm Nadeem - <a>passionate programmer</a> and an <a>indie hacker</a> holding it down in the tech hub of
            Bangalore, India.
          </p>
          <p>I build <a>end-to-end solutions</a> with a knack for <a>crafting ideas</a> and <a>solving complex</a>
            problems.</p>
          <p>My love affair with coding ignited way back in 8th grade â€“ a curious kid fascinated by computers</p>
          <p>Fast forward, and I'm still hooked, channeling that passion to cook up products and experiences that pack a
            punch.</p>
          <p>Oh, and if you catch me doodling, that's my inner illustrator taking the spotlight. As for writing? Well,
            let's just say I'm still working on that one. But hey, who said you can't master it all?
